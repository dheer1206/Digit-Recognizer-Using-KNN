# Digit-Recognizer-Using-KNN

Digit recogniton using K-nearest neighbours algorithm on the MNIST dataset .

The model was first trained on the grayscale images in Model.ipynb file .

Then , i converted the images in binary to see if the score gets better. Unfortunately , I didn't saw any improvement in the score .
There is a seperate file Model_binary_images.ipynb that contains the code for this optimization .
